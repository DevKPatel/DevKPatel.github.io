    <pre>Welcome to the online treasure hunt. Great if you made it till here. Till now it was really easy but the fun part begin now.
        The difficulty is that you have to guess the code and enter below. And it will keep increasing as you go (from easy to medium to hard).
        <br>
        Story line:- On 15th july 2024, there was a guy named Dev who joined the pace creators team for the 1st time. He was someone who had a lot of fun
        with everyone. Just after joining the class something in his mind came up and that something is what you really have to find to move on to
        the next step. Enter the correct answer below to go further. But before trying anything there is something in the image section but i am
        not sure what is it. Find it Mr. Dectective!
        <br>
        (NOTE:- Enter the correct answer without any spaces and in "UPPERCASE")

        Difficulty:- easy
