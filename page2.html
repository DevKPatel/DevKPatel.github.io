        Story line:- On the first day, he came up and had a personal talk with the Deepak sir. Deepak sir said
        something which was confidential and not for everyone. So ofcourse he came up with the idea that
        the conversation needs to be encrypted and for that he used a cipher text which only Dev and Deepak sir could
        understand. The cipher text was "TDEWNMESOAOFTSNYHUTLOH". Ohh crap i cant understand anything. Try to figure out
        what is the connection of the image with this cipher. Also during the decryption you will need a key which will be
        the addition of the digits of the date when Dev joined the class.
